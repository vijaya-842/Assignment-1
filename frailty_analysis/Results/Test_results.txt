The summary statistics provide a snapshot of the datasetâ€™s key features:

Height:
 Mean: 68.6 inches
 Range: 65.8 to 71.5 inches

Weight:
 Mean: 131.9 lbs
 Range: 112 to 153 lbs

Age:
 Mean: 32.5 years
 Range: 17 to 51 years

Grip Strength:
 Mean: 26 kg
 Range: 19 to 31 kg

Frailty (0 = No, 1 = Yes):
 Mean: 0.4 (40% of participants exhibit frailty symptoms)
 Range: 0 to 1 (indicating that some participants show frailty, while others do not)

The correlation matrix reveals the following relationships between variables:

Height & Weight: Moderate positive correlation (0.57), suggesting taller individuals typically weigh more.
Height & Age: Very weak negative correlation (-0.03), indicating no significant relationship.
Height & Frailty: Weak positive correlation (0.19), implying that taller individuals may have a slightly higher likelihood of being frail.
Weight & Grip Strength: Very weak positive correlation (0.03), suggesting a negligible relationship.
Weight & Frailty: Moderate positive correlation (0.54), indicating that heavier individuals may be more susceptible to frailty.
Age & Grip Strength: Very weak positive correlation (0.13), suggesting age alone is not a strong predictor of grip strength.
Grip Strength & Frailty: Moderate negative correlation (-0.48), suggesting that lower grip strength is associated with an increased likelihood of frailty.
